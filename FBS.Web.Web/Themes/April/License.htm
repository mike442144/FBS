     Work&quot;</span></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>
     means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in
     which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with one or more
     other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in
     themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes

     works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization,
     fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art
     reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the
     Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that
     constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for
     the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is
     a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work
     in timed-relation with a moving image (&quot;synching&quot;) will be
     considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. </span></li>

     may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally

     include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License
     with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly

     offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this
     License or the ability of a recipient of the Work to exercise the rights
     granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not

     License and to the disclaimer of warranties. When You distribute, publicly
     display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work, You may
     not impose any technological measures on the Work that restrict the
     ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted

     applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does
     not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made
     subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work,
     upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove
     from the Collective Work any credit as required by Section 4(b), as
     requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor
     You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any
     credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. </span></li>

     Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., &quot;French translation of the Work by
     Original Author,&quot; or &quot;Screenplay based on original Work by
     Original Author&quot;). The credit required by this Section 4(b) may be
